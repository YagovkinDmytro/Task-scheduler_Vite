#Task-scheduler Vite

## First of all, let's write down the basic requirements for the interface and the logic of the program:

- The interface should consist of several parts: A header with information about tasks and filters
- A form with an input field for creating new tasks
- A list of tasks
- The header should display:
- The number of completed and uncompleted tasks
- Task list filters with the values "All", "Active" and "Completed"
- Each item in the task list should have:
- A paragraph with the text that the user entered into the form when creating the task
- A checkbox for switching the status "completed"
- A button to delete the task
